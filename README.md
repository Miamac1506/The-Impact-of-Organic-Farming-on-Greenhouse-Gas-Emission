## The Impact of Organic Farming on Greenhouse Gas Emission

### Introduction
This research investigates the relationship between organic farming and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the United States. While organic farming is celebrated for its environmental benefits, including soil carbon sequestration and reduced chemical use, its effect on GHG emissions remains contentious. Using state-level data from 2000 to 2008, this study explores whether expanding certified organic acreage contributes to lowering total GHG emissions.

### Data Collection
The data includes:
- Total GHG emissions (million metric tons of CO2 equivalent), GDP, and state populations from the World Resource Institute (1990–2018).
- Certified organic pasture and cropland acreage (USDA, 2000–2011).
  
Panel data from 50 U.S. states between 2000 and 2008 was analyzed, yielding 450 observations. Missing values for organic acreage were assumed to be zero to ensure co
  
### Methodology
An econometric model was developed to analyze the relationship between total GHG emissions and certified organic acreage. The dependent variable was total GHG emissions, while key explanatory variables included:

Total certified organic acreage (rescaled to thousands of acres).
State GDP.
Population.
Fixed effects models were employed to control for unobserved state and time variations. The hypothesis posited that an increase in organic acreage would correlate negatively with total GHG emissions.

### Results
1. OLS Model: Showed a significant positive correlation between organic farming acreage and GHG emissions, contrary to expectations.
2. Fixed Effects Model: After controlling for state and time-fixed effects, the correlation between organic farming acreage and GHG emissions became statistically insignificant.
3. Other Variables: Both state GDP and population were positively associated with emissions in the OLS model but became insignificant in the fixed effects model.

### Applications and Implications
The findings suggest that organic farming does not significantly reduce GHG emissions in the U.S. under the current conditions. The study highlights challenges such as:
- The lower yield of organic farming compared to conventional methods.
- Increased energy consumption for weed control and field operations in organic systems.
  
Policy implications include the need for more nuanced approaches to promoting organic farming, addressing inefficiencies, and understanding regional variations in climate, soil quality, and energy use. Future research should explore non-linear models and incorporate delayed effects of soil carbon sequestration.
